    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Believe it or not, the best beer batter isn't made with beer! It's actually done with sparkling apple cider, which
    produces a light, beautifully crispy, and very flavorful coating. Not to mention it's super easy.</p>
    <p>Finger Lickin' Good!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken Breast</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Cayenne Pepper</li>
        <li>All purpose flour</li>
        <li>Self rising flour</li>
        <li>Apple cider</li>
        <li>Canola Oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut each chicken breast into 6 finger-sized strips, and transfer into a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Season with kosher salt, black pepper, and cayenne and toss until evenly coated. Sprinkle the all-purpose flour over top
        and shake the bowl to coat the strips. Toss until all the surfaces are completely coated, and then transfer onto a rack
        or plate. Place in the refrigerator, uncovered, for at least 10 minutes, or until ready to fry.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, whisk self-rising flour and sparkling apple cider together in a mixing bowl to form a thin batter. Batter
        should be somewhere between a thin pancake batter and a crepe batter, but still thick enough to coat the back of a
        spoon. Place in the refrigerator to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before using.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Dip each chicken finger into the batter to coat. Deep-fry in batches in the hot oil until golden brown, crispy, and no
        longer pink in the centers, 3 to 4 1/2 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve immediately with dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>

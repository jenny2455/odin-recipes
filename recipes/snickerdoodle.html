        <p>Thanks for making it past the gigantic image.</p>
        <p>These snickerdoodle cookies have a hint of apple butter for a different take on the classic favorite.</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>Cream of Tartar</li>
        <li>Baking Soda</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>
        <li>Nutmeg</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, salt, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and nutmeg in a medium bowl until
        combined.</li>
        <li>Mix together butter and 1 1/2 cups sugar in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Stir in egg and vanilla until
        incorporated. Add apple butter and mix until combined. Pour in 1/2 of the dry ingredients and mix until just combined.
        Add remaining dry ingredients and mix just until no dry clumps of flour remain. Cover bowl and refrigerate for at least
        2 hours, or up to 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Mix together remaining 1/4 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons cinnamon in a shallow bowl or pie pan. Drop tablespoon-sized
        pieces of dough into the cinnamon-sugar mixture and roll into balls, coating well. Place 1 inch apart on the prepared
        baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are just set, about 10 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheets for 5
        minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
